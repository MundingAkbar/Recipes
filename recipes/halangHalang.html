                   <p>Remove and discard the dark green layers of the lemongrass until you get to the lighter green part. With a knife, cut into lengths that will fit inside the chicken's cavity. Using the back of the knife, pound ends of lemongrass to release flavor.</p>
                   <p>In a pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions, garlic, and ginger and garlic and cook until softened.</p>
                   <p>Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned.</p>
                   <p>Add fish sauce and continue to cook for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
                   <p>Add coconut milk, chili peppers, and lemongrass. Bring to a simmer.</p>
                   <p>Cover and cook for about 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.</p>
                   <p>Add papaya and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes or until papaya is tender and sauce is thickened.</p>
                   <p>Remove lemongrass and discard. Season with salt to taste.</p>
                   <p>Add spinach and cook until just wilted. Serve hot.</p>
